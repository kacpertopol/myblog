# monads and "do" notation in the *Wolfram Language*, part 2
<center>

introduction of monadic types ...



This is the second post in of a series on the "do" notation in the *Wolfram Language*.
In the
<a id = "NCE" href = https://kacpertopol.github.io/myblog/2021-01-31_gen_light.html>first</a>
post a categorical interpretation of the *Wolfram Language* was introduced. Now it is time
for monads. 

A user can implement a monad *m* in the WL by supplying three
definitions. The first definition:

```Mathematica
    pattern[m] = (*pattern m a*)
```

provides a pattern that matches a WL expression if it is an *m* monad
for any type argument *a*. The second definition implements the monadic
*return* function:

```Mathematica
    return[m][x_] := (*expression matching pattern[m]*)
```

if the type of *x* is *a* then this expression should be a *m* monad for
type argument *a*. In particular the resulting WL expression should
match `pattern[m]`. The final definition is an implementation of the
monadic *bind* operator for *m*:

```Mathematica
    bind[m][ma_ , aTOmb_] := (*implementation of bind*)
```

where *ma* is an *m* monad for type argument *a* and *aTOmb* is a
function taking an element of type *a* and returning an *m* monad for
type argument *b*. The user does not have to supply additional pattern
constraints in `bind`, however it is up to the user to make sure that
these definitions result in an object that satisfies the monad laws.

Having these three definitions for monad *m*, the implementation of the
"do\" notation in the WL is straightforward and consists of two parts.
The first is a recursive definition that reduces the `do[m]` expression
by applying the user defined `bind[m]` operator:

```Mathematica
    do[m_][x___ , y_ , r:Except[_LeftArrow]]:= 
       If[MatchQ[y , LeftArrow[_ , _]] , 
          do[m][x , 
             chk[m][
             bnd[m][snd[y] , 
                Function[Evaluate[fst[y]] , r]]]
             ],
          do[m][x , 
             chk[m][bnd[m][y , 
                Function[Unique["nonExistantVariable"] , r]]]
          ]
       ];
```

Here `bnd[m]` will be replaced by the appropriate user supplied
`bind[m]` function when the first argument matches `pattern[m]` and the
second argument is a function, `fst`, `snd` are helper functions that
take the left and right expression from a `LeftArrow` statement, and
finally `chk[m]` is a function that checks the result of `bind[m]`
against the user defined `pattern[m]`. Once `do[m]` is reduced to a
contain a single expression the final expression is checked and
returned:

```Mathematica
    do[m_][mx_]:=chk[m][mx];
```

These definitions together with the supplementary functions are provided
for the readers convenience

The repository contains a
short WL package *wlmonad.wl* and a number of examples. Next time we will look at the 
Hanoi Tower example.
