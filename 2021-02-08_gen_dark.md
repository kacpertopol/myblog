*Hanoi Tower* example ...



The first 
<a id = "NCE" href = https://kacpertopol.github.io/myblog/2021-01-31_gen_light.html>post</a>
in this series introduced a categorical look at the *Wolfram Language*.
The second
<a id = "NCE" href =https://kacpertopol.github.io/myblog/2021-02-04_gen_light.html>post</a>
introduced monadic types and the *do*. Now it is time for an example application.


Here we take a look at the classic Hanoi Tower puzzle. The puzzle
consists of three poles onto which stacks of disks with different sizes
$1 , 2 , 3 , \ldots$ can be placed. At the beginning of the puzzle all
disks are stacked on the first pole with smaller disks being placed on
top of larger ones. The aim of the puzzle is to transport all disks from
the first pole to the third pole in discrete steps. In each step only
one disk can be taken from the top of a stack and placed on a larger
disk or on an empty pole.

The puzzle is solved in the *hanoi_tower_example.nb* notebook from
<a id = "NCE" href = https://gitlab.com/kacpertopolnicki/wlmonad>here</a>. 
The notebook starts with a definition of a pattern for the Hanoi
Tower puzzle:

```Mathematica
    towers = {_List , _List , _List};
```

The puzzle will be represented by a list containing three elements. Each
element is a list and corresponds to a single pole of the puzzle.
Elements of this list will be numbers corresponding to disc sizes.
Another pattern is provided for expressions that will be used to record
the moves that lead to the solution:

```Mathematica
    move = {_ -> _ , {_List , _List , _List}};
```

Moves will be two element lists, the first element (e.g. `1->2`) will
record the number of the pole from which the disk was taken and the
number of the pole onto which the disk was dropped (e.g. `1` , `2`). The
second element will contain the current configuration of the puzzle.

Next three definitions are provided for the *hT* monad that will be used
in a recursive solution to the puzzle. The first definition is a pattern
that will match any WL expression that is an *hT* monad for any type
argument:

```Mathematica
    pattern[hT] = hT[towers , {move ...}];
```

Next the return function is defined as (please note that an empty list
also matches `{move ...}`):

```Mathematica
    return[hT][x_] := hT[x , {}];
```

Finaly the bind operator for *hT* is given (please note that no
additional pattern constraints are necessary for `ma` and `aTomb`):

```Mathematica
    bind[hT][ma_ , aTomb_] := 
       With[
          {val = aTomb[grab[ma]]}, 
          hT[grab[val] , join[rest[ma], rest[val]]]
       ];
```

where `grab` and `rest` are helper functions:

```Mathematica
    grab[ma : pattern[hT]] := ma[[1]];
    rest[ma : pattern[hT]] := ma[[2]];
```	

and `join` provides a lazy version of the `Join` function:

```Mathematica
    join[a : {move ...} , b : {move ...}] := Join[a , b];
```	

Providing lazy functions that evaluate only when they are called with
appropriate arguments is important for recursion.

Only one action is provided for this monad with two definitions. The
first one moves a single disk of puzzle `tower` from pole number `from`
to pole number `to`:

```Mathematica
    moveDiscs[from_ , to_ , 1][tower : towers] :=
       Module[{newtower},
          newtower = ReplacePart[
             ReplacePart[
                tower , 
                to -> Join[tower[[from]][[1 ;; 1]], tower[[to]]]
             ] , 
             from -> tower[[from , 2 ;;]]
          ];
          hT[newtower , {{from -> to , newtower}}]
       ];
```	   

The second one moves `n` disks from pole number `from` to pole number
`to`. This time the definition uses the "do\" notation and recursion:

```Mathematica
    moveDiscs[from_ , to_ , n_][tower : towers] :=
       do[hT][
          toOther <- moveDiscs[
                      from , 
                      other[from , to] , 
                      n - 1][tower],
          toGoal <- moveDiscs[
                      from , 
                      to , 
                      1][toOther],
          finalMove <- moveDiscs[
                         other[from , to] , 
                         to , 
                         n - 1][toGoal],
          return[hT][finalMove]
       ];
```	   

where `<-` is the `LeftArrow` operator (`<ESC><-<ESC>` in the WL) and
`other[i , j]` returns a pole number that is different then `i` and `j`.
The procedure of solving the puzzle can be read off directly from the
code above. First $n-1$ disks are moved from pole number `from` to a
pole that is different from `from` and `to`. Next, one disk is moved
from pole number `from` to pole number `to`. Finaly the $n-1$ disks are
moved from the other pole to the `to` pole.

A solution to the puzzle with three disks on the first pole in the
initial configuration can be obtained by evaluating:

```Mathematica
    moveDiscs[1 , 3 , 3][makeTower[3]]
```	

where `makeTower[3]` prepares the initial configuration of the puzzle.
The result is:

```Mathematica
    hT[
       {{},{},{1,2,3}},
       {
          {1->3,{{2,3},{},{1}}},
          {1->2,{{3},{2},{1}}},
          {3->2,{{3},{1,2},{}}},
          {1->3,{{},{1,2},{3}}},
          {2->1,{{1},{2},{3}}},
          {2->3,{{1},{},{2,3}}},
          {1->3,{{},{},{1,2,3}}}
       }
    ]
```	

The first element of this expression is the final configuration of the
solved puzzle. The second element is a list containing the moves used to
obtain the solution.

The

contains more examples including a *list* monad and a
*maybe* monad. The reader is encouraged to download and explore these
notebooks.

The *Mathematica* system has a very powerful set of built
in functions. The flexibility of the *Wolfram Language* makes it
possible to program in many different styles. Such freedom can, however,
be overwhelming and it is a good idea to conform to styles of
programming that are tailored to particular problems. Combining the
monadic style of programming with the powerful standard library of the
*Wolfram Language* can be very useful for problems that require a
functional solution. There are many ways of implementing this style of
programming in the *Wolfram Language*, I think that the
method presented here is relatively simple and robust.
