---title--- monads and "do" notation in the *Wolfram Language*, part 1
---abstract--- motivation, categorical interpretation of the *Wolfram Language*

This is the first part of a series of posts that introduce "do" notation
to the *Wolfram Language*. There are many ways of doing this. I will be 
using an approach described in my <a id = "NCE" href = https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09478>article</a>
on *arXiv*, these posts will be slightly edited versions of section from that paper.

The motivation for this work stems from a practical problem of writing a
*Wolfram Language* (WL) application aimed to abstract away the notion of
scalar valued functions for numerical computations. The goal was for the
user to specify, in the WL, the number of arguments for a function,
which arguments are discrete indices and which arguments are floating
point numbers. For floating point arguments the user additionally
defines points and weights used for interpolations and integrations over
these arguments and finally specifies which arguments can be used for
purposes of code parallelization. Given this input, the job of the
application is to create a *FORTRAN 90* module and a directory with
supplementary data. The user can import this module and work with an
abstraction of the scalar valued functions: store function values on
different cores and handle them using different *MPI* and *OPENMP*
threads, interpolate function values and integrate over function
arguments.

The implementation works, more or less :-)
Basing the implementation around monadic types was really helpful.
The monadic style of programming
can also be appropriate for many other problems. Here a
simple approach to include monads and the *Haskell* style "do\" notation
in the WL is proposed. This combined with the powerful functions built
into the *Mathematica* system can lead to
the production of very powerful code.

This work was influenced by an excellent 
<a id = "NCE" href = https://www.blurb.com/b/9621951-category-theory-for-programmers-new-edition-hardco>book</a> by Bartosz Milewski
containing an introduction to Category Theory. First, in this post,
a categorical interpretation of
the WL is introduced. In the next post the
implementation of monadic types and the "do" notation will be described. 
Further posts will contain
examples and tips for practical implementations.
The text contains snippets of WL code and pseudo-code. Some
code fragments will use comments `(*...*)` to hold additional
information intended for interpretation by the reader.

In order to think about the WL as a category a subset of the WL will be
considered consisting of functions defined in the following manner:

```Mathematica
    f[(*pattern a*)] := (*expression*)
```

where *f* stands for the function name (other symbols can also be used),
*pattern a* is a WL language pattern expression that specifies the
arguments accepted by the function *f* and *expression* is a WL
expression that can be constructed from the named parts of *pattern a*.
This is not directly enforced by the WL, but ideally all possible
results of *f* match a different pattern, *pattern b*, so that:

```Mathematica
    MatchQ[f[(*expression matching pattern a*)],(*pattern b*)]
```

is always true. Curried functions can be used and this can be
interpreted as replacing `f` with `f[x]`, `f[x][y]`, ... in the pseudo
code above and treating the replacement as a whole set of functions
built from the different values of `x`, `y`, ...

It is seems natural to treat this subset of the WL as a category with
morphisms being functions (e.g. `f`, `f[x]`, `f[x][y]`, ...) and objects
being types defined by WL patterns (e.g. the set of all WL expressions
that match *pattern a* defines type *a* and the set of expressions that
match *pattern b* defines type *b*). In this context a monad is a type
function: it takes a pattern that defines one type and returns a new
pattern that defines a different type. Some additional definitions are
necessary and they discussed next time.
